Her research, and that of her working group, was nurtured by a strong theoretical-experimental interaction, facing the challenge of interpreting and explaining experimental results and properties of a wide variety of complex and low-dimensional systems and materials.\n\n    Her research activity focused on the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties of materials with complex and low-dimensional structures. In the early 90s, she began to work on transition metal multilayers, thin films, and clusters, later expanding to quantum confinement effects and spin-polarized and tunnel transport through metal/semiconductor heterostructures. In the last decade, her focus shifted to the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials, particularly thin films and nanostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides, as well as complex oxides.\n\n    Prof. Llois is currently the Vice President of the University of San Mart\xedn, UNSAM.",articles:[{title:"Magnetic transition and spin-polarized two-dimensional electron gas controlled by polarization switching in strained CaMnO3/BaTiO3 slabs.",link:"https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.8.034408",publication_date:"2024/3"},{title:"Numerical study of defects in protactinium carbide.",link:"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352214322000570",publication_date:"2022/9/1"},{title:"Numerical study of defects in protactinium carbide",link:"https://ri.conicet.gov.ar/handle/11336/187424",publication_date:"2022/9"}],scholar:"https://scholar.google.com.ar/citations?user=e8XpUUgAAAAJ&hl=en",image:"/speakers/ana-maria-llois.jpg",slug:"ana-maria-llois",job:"Vice President of the University of San Mart\xedn, UNSAM."}];function c(){return(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:o()(["flex flex-row items-start gap-8 h-full overflow-hidden absolute hover:animate-pause animate-slideLeftSpeakers transition py-2"]),children:[r,r].flat().map((e,i)=>(0,a.jsx)(s.default,{href:e.slug,target:"_blank",children:(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"group flex w-44 justify-center items-center flex-col gap-4 h-full rounded-2xl overflow-hidden cursor-pointer",children:[(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"grayscale group-hover:grayscale-0 group-hover:rounded-lg opacity-100 duration-300 ease-in-out w-44 h-44 rounded-full overflow-hidden transition-all",children:(0,a.jsx)("img",{src:e.image,alt:e.name,className:"w-full h-full absolute object-cover"})}),(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"grayscale group-hover:grayscale-0",children:(0,a.jsx)("h1",{className:"text-lg font-medium text-blue-link text-center",children:e.name})})]})},i))})}},60968:function(e,i,t){"use strict";t.r(i),t.d(i,{default:function(){return l}});var a=t(57437),n=t(2265),o=t(47907),s=t(8792),r=t(16480),c=t.n(r);function l(e){let{homeElement:i,separator:t,capitalizeLinks:r,containerClasses:l,listClasses:d,transformLabel:h}=e,u=(0,o.usePathname)(),p=null==u?void 0:u.split("/").filter(e=>e),g=e=>{let i=e.replaceAll("-"," ").split(" ");return h&&(i=h(i).map(e=>"".concat(e))),i.map(e=>e.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+e.slice(1)).join(" ")};return(0,a.jsx)("div",{children:(0,a.jsxs)("ul",{className:c()(["flex gap-1 text-sm font-medium",l]),children:[(0,a.jsx)("li",{className:d,children:(0,a.jsx)(s.default,{href:"/",children:i})}),p&&(null==p?void 0:p.length)>0&&t,null==p?void 0:p.map((e,i)=>{let o="/".concat(null==p?void 0:p.slice(0,i+1).join("/")),c=r?g(e):e.replaceAll("-"," ");return(0,a.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsxs)("li",{className:"underline",children:[" ",(0,a.jsx)(s.default,{href:o,children:c})," "]}),(null==p?void 0:p.length)!==i+1&&t]},i)})]})})}}},function(e){e.O(0,[444,971,69,744],function(){return e(e.s=6497)}),_N_E=e.O()}]);
